		<h2>The series</h2>
		<p>The Kingkiller Chronicle is a fantasy book series by Patrick Rothfuss, which recounts the story of Kvothe, an adventurer and musician. The book is largely told in a "story-within-a-story" format, where the reader learns about the story of Kvothe's life as he narrates it to a scribe. The first two books, The Name of the Wind and The Wise Man's Fear, were released in 2007 and 2011, respectively. Despite a decade having passed, the third novel titled The Doors of Stone has not yet been released. The two released books have sold over 10 million copies.</p>

		<h2>The books</h2>
		<h3>The Name Of The Wind</h3>
		<p>So begins the tale of Kvothe - currently known as Kote, the unassuming innkeepter - from his childhood in a troupe of traveling players, through his years spent as a near-feral orphan in a crime-riddled city, to his daringly brazen yet successful bid to enter a difficult and dangerous school of magic. In these pages you will come to know Kvothe the notorious magician, the accomplished thief, the masterful musician, the dragon-slayer, the legend-hunter, the lover, the thief and the infamous assassin.</p>
		<h3>The Wise Man's Fear</h3>
		<p>So begins a tale told from his own point of view—a story unequaled in fantasy literature. Now in The Wise Man’s Fear, Day Two of The Kingkiller Chronicle, Kvothe takes his first steps on the path of the hero and learns how difficult life can be when a man becomes a legend in his own time.</p>
